# Dapp-Template
This repository is a monorepo setup for a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages a modern stack including Next.js, Hardhat, and The Graph. Managed using PNPM, this monorepo facilitates modular development across different aspects of the DApp ecosystemâ€”from the frontend interface to smart contracts and data indexing via subgraphs.
